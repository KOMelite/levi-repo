# Levi: 

    A quick and efficient tool to copy details from a bank document (pdf) to excel file.
---

## Why Levi as the name? 
    One of the meanings behind the name is 'United in harmony'. 
    
    Dealing with FNB bank documents directly is painfully difficult when you need access to the data within...
    Thankfully Levi attempts to decode the bank documents into a excell file for your formatting needs.

### Notes:

- Current version only works for most recent FNB bank documents.
- Application very rigid and not flexible to customization.
- Application is not ready for distrubution.
- Application not user friendly.
- Lots of reformating still required as well as addition of doc strings to functions...
  addition of classes, tests, and setup files...
