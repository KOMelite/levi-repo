### Notes:

- Current version only works for most recent FNB bank documents.
- Application very rigid and not flexible to customization.
- Application is not ready for distrubution.
- Application not user friendly.
- Lots of reformating still required as well as addition of doc strings to functions...
  addition of classes, tests, and setup files...
